    "We use Python code to generate prompts for the LLM. The prompts include a demographic profile of a survey respondents and a description of the two dilemma that the survey respondents encountered during the Moral Machine experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The demographic profile includes the age, education, gender, and income that survey respondents reported in an optional demographic survey upon completion of the experiment. The order in which these characteristics appear in the prompt is randomized. \n",
    "\n",
    "The description of the scenarios is generated from the replication data provided by Awad et al. (2018). One dilemma consists of two scenarios, presented side by side during the experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the descriptions of the dilemmas, we extended code written by Takemoto (2024). This study generates new dilemmas by randomly combining features of scenarios (e.g. the composition of characters) and prompts LLMs to evaluate these dilemmas. In contrast, our study takes the existing dilemmas from Awad et al. (2018) and prompts LLMs to predict how survey respondents evluated the dilemmas.\n",

    "Below we illustrate how the entries in the data matrix describe a scenario. We created the images with the design functionalities of [moralmachine.net](https://www.moralmachine.net/). These images illustrate the examples but play no further role in the study. "
