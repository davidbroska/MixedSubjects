    "The demographic profile on the age, education, gender, and income that survey respondents reported after the Moral Machine experiment. The order in which these characteristics appear is randomized. It was up to the respondents to decide whether to take the survey or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The description of the scenarios is generated from the data matrix. One dilemma consists of two scenarios, presented side by side during the experiment. If respondents click on the left side, they opt for the death of the characters represented in that outcome while the characters on the right side will be saved (and vice versa). \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the descriptions of the dilemmas, we extended code written by Takemoto (2024). This study generates new dilemmas by randomly combining features of scenarios (e.g. the composition of characters) and prompts LLMs to evaluate these dilemmas. In contrast, our study takes the existing dilemmas from Awad et al. (2018) and prompts LLMs to predict how survey respondents evluated the dilemmas."
